To have JAXB (version 2) bind the OGC 
schema's to Java Classes using the xjc the following
modifications must be made to these schema's.

1) Add the following global customisation to the schema in question:

	<xsd:annotation>
		<xsd:appinfo>
			<jaxb:globalBindings underscoreBinding="asCharInWord"/>
		</xsd:appinfo>
	</xsd:annotation>
	
This is needed because normally JAXB interprets the underscore
as a punctuation character. So it is deleted, and camel-case is
applied. OGC schema, however, contain names such as "Geometry" and "_Geometry".
With underscores treated as punctuations, these names are mapped to the same
Java identifier and therefore conflict.


2) Add 'jaxb:version="2.0"' to the <xsd:schema> element. This instructs JAXB to use version 2.0
of JAXB.

3) the presence of many versions of the same schema can confuse JAXB. Delete those versions that 
are unnecessary.
